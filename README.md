# GTEx_Testis_Analysis
This repository contains scripts used for the analysis of 170 whole genome and testis RNAseq data set from GTEx.  

The name of the folders describe the type of scripts it contains. Within each folder there is a file which describes all the steps performed to generate the desired output. The link to reference files used and parameters used to process them are also made available.

## Data

The data used in this study can be downloaded from GTEx project on dbGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000424.v7.p2).

## Processing

The folders 1, 2 and 3 explains how the GTEx dataset was analysed to obtain ampliconic gene copy number, Y haplogroup and expression level respectively.

Tables with ampliconic gene copy number, Y haplogroup and expression levels of 170 individuals are loaded into the R scripts provided in the data analysis (4th) folder to generate the figures and tables presented in the paper.
