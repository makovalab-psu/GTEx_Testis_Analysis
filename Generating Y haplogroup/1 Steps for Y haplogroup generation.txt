Step 1: Download GTEx datasets in BAM format from dbGAP.

	Downloaded ONLY THE Y CHROMOSOME ALIGNMENTS for each GTEx sample. List of sample ids used is available in the supplementary file. 

Step 2: Generate pileup of the Y chromosome to extract the nucleotides at locations Yhaplo uses to predict the haplogroup. (Yhaplo works only on hg19 reference)

Download GTEx specific reference.
	wget https://storage.googleapis.com/gtex_analysis_v7/reference/Homo_sapiens_assembly19.fasta.gz

Run mpileup using the downloaded reference.
	samtools mpileup -f Homo_sapiens_assembly19.fasta SAMPLE_NAME.bam -r "Y:2655100-28771000" > SAMPLE_NAME_hg19_chrY_2655100_28771000.pileup


Step 3: Generate Yhaplo input file using the pileup output for each BAM file. The python code makes use of example dataset provided by Yhaplo (1000Y.subset.genos.txt) to generate a similar file with SNPs from the sample BAM. 

	python make_input.py SAMPLE_NAME_hg19_chrY_2655100_28771000.pileup SAMPLE_NAME_hg19.genos.txt
	Note: Set path of 1000Y.subset.genos.txt to "Test_input"  by downloading the file (wget https://github.com/23andMe/yhaplo/blob/master/data/1000Y.subset.genos.txt) or use it from your Yhaplo installation (/galaxy/home/rxv923/src/yhaplo/data/1000Y.subset.genos.txt)


Step 4: Run Yhaplo
	
	python /galaxy/home/rxv923/src/yhaplo/callHaplogroups.py -i SAMPLE_NAME_hg19.genos.txt


Step 5: Parse the output files for 170 samples and create a summary table.

	python GTEX_WGS_parse_outputfiles.py (Same step is run to generate summary of copy number data. Run it only once when both AmpliCoNE and Yhaplo output for all samples are generated.)
	Note: Set the paths within the code before running. Yhap should be run and the output of AmpliCoNE and Yhaplo must be in same subfolders for each sample.


You get a file GTEX_Yhaplogroups_YchrBAM.tab which is used in the downstream analysis. The rows are samples with haplogroup information parsed from output/haplogroups.SAMPLE_NAME_hg19.txt.

Additionally, provided code to generate symlink for genomic data and slurm jobs to run AmpliCoNE and Yhaplo automatically. Example slurm job is also provided under copy number folder.
